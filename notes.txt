    Functions can be returned as return values from other functions


count() //=> 1
count() //=> 2
count() //=> 3

Collections
    Array
        Fixed size collection
        The data has to be of the same type

    Slice
        Variable size collection
        It uses an Array internally
        The data has to be of the same type
        Apis to manipulate a slice (append, len)

    Map
        collection of key/value pairs
        The type of the key and value are customizable
